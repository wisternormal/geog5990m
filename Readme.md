#Python Computer Exercise Assessment 1

#Introduction

The aim of this programme is to make a communication between agents and environment. Using animation to display the result.

#Installation

We install Spyder (Python 3.7) from Anaconda 3 to run Python codes and files.

#Usage

First, we create a python file called 'agentframework.py'. The functions of this python file are
1. Initilize every agents. 
2. Define two agents distance
3. Make a connection between agents and environment 
4. Make agents move randomly 
5. Make agents communicate with each other.

After that import file 'agentframework' into 'model.py'. The file 'model.py' have many functions which are 
1. Get the agents information from the web 
2. Initialize animination 
3. Get the environment from flie 'in.txt'. 
4. Initialize the solid variable 
5. Make the agents from the web data. 
6. Shuffle the agents list.
7. Animanation the model. 
8. Deifne and implements the agents' action 
9. Plot the agents and the environment 
10.Do a GUI mdoel. 
11.This is title which can modify
