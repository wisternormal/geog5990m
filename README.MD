# Python Computer Exercise Assessment 1

# Introduction

The purpose of this programme is to make a communication between agents and environment. Running an animation model to display and get results.

# Installation

Install Spyder (Python 3.7) from Anaconda Navigator 3 in the computer and run Python codes and files.

# Usage

Open the software Anaconda Navigator and select the 'Spyder (Python 3.7)'. Open two python files called 'agentframework.py' and 'model.py'. 'model.py' is the main programme.

The following steps illustrate the functions of python files and the usage to run Python codes.

Firstly, a python file called 'agentframework.py'. The functions of this python file which included:

1. Initilize every agents.
2. Define two agents distance.
3. Make a connection between agents and environment.
4. Make agents move randomly.
5. Make agents communicate with each other.

Secondly, import file 'agentframework' into 'model.py'. The file 'model.py' have many functions which are

1. Get the agents information from the web.
2. Initialize animination.
3. Get the environment from flie 'in.txt'.
4. Initialize the solid variable.
5. Make the agents from the web data.
6. Shuffle the agents list.
7. Animanation the model.
8. Define and implements the agents' action.
9. Plot the agents and the environment. 
10. Do a GUI model. 
11. This is title which can modify.

Thirdly, holding 'Shift' button, right click in the file, open the 'windows Powershell', input the code 'python model.py', run the model and get results.
The results of these codes: many agents in the environment move randomly in the 100x100 units. This is like 'the sheep eating grass', agents represent sheeps and black marks demonstrate the location where sheeps ate the grass. Once the agents move, it has black marks.
